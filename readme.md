# Multi Layer Perceptron Implementation

Multi Layer Perceptron is implemented using c++ language and stl with no 3rd party library. 

## Getting Started

You need to compile with at least c++17 compiler. I haven't used platfrom specific library, with a decent compiler you should be fine.

## API
TODO: add example usage of the Model class here

### Prerequisites

Compiler should support C++17

## TODO

Add dropout, allow type conversion between different integral and different floating point types during initialization,
add different initialization methods for weights and biases. Change Model initialization api

## Contributing

You can just push your changes, I may merge it after review
